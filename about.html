  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Intrests:</h2>
  <p>I enjoy computers, screamo, and games.</p>
  <p>As for what I enjoy in computer land that would be</p>
  <p>Coding and gaming mostly. I have minor skills in Unity, C#, and Js. I also know a little Python and Lua.</p>
  <p>And extensive skills in Blender, Photoshop, HTML and CSS.</p>
  <p>I hope to one day make a career out of my computer skills. Hopefully going into</p>
  <p>Animation with a job at Pixar. But I would settle for IT or Game creation.</p>
  
  <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
  <p>I love binge watching TV shows and eating. I will often do both at the same time.</p>
  <p>I also love making things, like hand held catapults or WMDs :P</p>
  <p>Although I have recently been into game creation, and hopefully will epand my knowledge of it</p>
  <p>to the point that I can make a career out of it if needed or desired.</p>
  <p>Also, I love LEDs. Light period fasinates me. The speed, movement, everything.</p>
  
  <h2>My Freinds:</h2>
  <p>I have few freinds.</p>
  <p>A few as in 2.</p>
  <p>They are Sawyer and well, Nobody.</p>
  <p>Nobody, is a what some might call a godsend.</p>
<p>But I call him David. Some people think he dosent exist...</p>
<p>They are wrong... He does, just in some alternate dimension where unicorns eat rainbows and poop butterflys.</p>
<p>Just kidding! Some really fucked up shit has happened in his life... I am assuming.</p>
<p>Really though, he is awesome.</p>
<p>And there is Sawyer.</p>
<p>He is also very cool.</p>
<p>I'm telling you at first I thought he was a asshole.</p>
<p>But boy was I wrong, that scrawny freak can sling Japanese anime</p>
<p>theme verses I never even knew existed. And the best part is... We don't even know Japanese!</p>  
<p>Really though, Sawyer is awesome.</p>
  
  
  
  <h2>Other Stuff:</h2>
  <p>Nobody is my Lifecoach</p>
  <p>I also Hate MineCraft</p>
  <p>I am not a big people person, unless ofcourse there is something in it for me, like money...</p>
