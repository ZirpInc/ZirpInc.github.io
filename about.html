  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Intrests:</h2>
  <p>I enjoy computers, screamo, and games.</p>
  <p>As for what I enjoy in computer land that would be</p>
  <p>Coding and gaming mostly. I have minor skills in Unity, C#, and Js. I also know a little Python and Lua.</p>
  <p>And extensive skills in Blender, Photoshop, HTML and CSS.</p>
  <p>I hope to one day make a career out of my computer skills. Hopefully going into</p>
  <p>Animation with a job at Pixar. But I would settle for IT or Game creation.</p>
  
  <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
  <p>I love binge watching TV shows and eating. I will often do both at the same time.</p>
  <p>I also love making things, like hand held catapults or WMDs :P</p>
  <p>Although I have recently been into game creation, and hopefully will epand my knowledge of it</p>
  <p>to the point that I can make a career out of it if needed or desired.</p>
  <p>Also, I love LEDs. Light period fasinates me. The speed, movement, everything.</p>
  
  <h2>Other Stuff:</h2>
  <p>Nobody is my Lifecoach</p>
  <p>I also Hate MineCraft</p>
  <p>I am not a big people person, unless ofcourse there is something in it for me, like money...</p>
